For Creating Merge Conflict -> 
    I created Git Commands.txt file in main branch as well as in newBranch.
    Text content of both the files are different at some lines (all in my case) so this will result in merge conflict when we try to merge newBranch with main.

To Resolve Merge Conflict ->
    I added the lines from both the branches the way I wanted.
